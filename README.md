# 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge_Day-5
Day 5 – Business Problems You Can Solve with Data

## Overview

On Day 5 of my 120-day Data Analytics Challenge, I focused on something foundational:
defining real business problems before jumping into analysis.

Instead of building dashboards immediately, I documented five common business challenges and broke them down into clear analytical questions. The goal was to practice structured thinking — understanding the problem, the data needed, and the potential impact.

This exercise reinforces an important principle:
Good analysis starts with the right question.

## Business Problems Identified

### 1. Customer Churn

Business Question:
Why are customers leaving and how can we reduce churn?

Analytical Approach:

* Analyze behavioral patterns (purchase frequency, activity levels)
* Identify high-risk customer segments
* Detect engagement decline prior to cancellation
* Build churn prediction models

Expected Impact:
Improved retention and increased customer lifetime value.

### 2. Declining Sales Performance

Business Question:
Why are sales dropping in certain regions or products?

Analytical Approach:

* Trend analysis over time
* Regional and product-level performance comparison
* Seasonality detection
* Identification of underperforming categories

Expected Impact:
Data-informed sales strategy and better revenue optimization.


3. Inefficient Marketing Spend

Business Question:
Which marketing campaigns are delivering the best ROI?

Analytical Approach:

* Campaign performance evaluation
* Cost per acquisition (CPA) analysis
* Conversion rate tracking
* Customer segmentation by response behavior

Expected Impact:
Optimized budget allocation and improved marketing effectiveness.

### 4. Inventory Management Issues

Business Question:
Why are we experiencing stockouts or overstocking?

Analytical Approach:

* Demand trend analysis
* Sales forecasting
* Inventory turnover evaluation
* Identification of slow-moving products

Expected Impact:
Reduced holding costs and improved supply chain efficiency.

### 5. Poor Customer Experience

Business Question:
Why are customers dissatisfied?

Analytical Approach:

* Feedback and review analysis
* Complaint categorization
* Response time measurement
* Customer satisfaction trend tracking

Expected Impact:
Improved service quality and stronger customer loyalty.

## Key Takeaway

This task highlighted that business problems are rarely “clean.”
Behind every simple question is messy, incomplete, and sometimes inconsistent data.

Before building any dashboard or model, clarity in problem definition is essential.

## Next Step

I will select one of these problems and build a small end-to-end analytical project, including:

* Data cleaning
* Exploratory analysis
* Insight generation
* Business recommendations

This repository will be updated as the project progresses.
